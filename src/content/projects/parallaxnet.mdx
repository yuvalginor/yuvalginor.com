Patent-pending neural network for image-based 3D reconstruction in autonomous driving. Deployed in millions of vehicles at Porsche, Hyundai, and Kia.

## More info

Led the full redesign and productization of a deep learning system for 3D reconstruction, replacing a broken legacy system. Designed the architecture, directed research, and guided optimization for on-chip deployment.
Stack included tensorflow and AWS for data preprocessing and training, and C++ for on-chip deployment.
Achieved ~52% median height-accuracy improvement and 2× runtime reduction. This was the first deep learning model developed in-house within a classical algorithm group, and paved the way for extended adoption of ML across the org.
