## Projects I've worked on

This is a non-comprehensive list of some things I've done and am proud of.  

* I led the end-to-end development of ParallaxNet, a now patent-pending deep neural network for 3D scene reconstruction and geometric object detection. It achieved accuracy 52% better than previous methods while simultaneously cutting runtime 2x, and was deployed in millions of vehicles at major automakers such as Porsche, Hyundai and Kia to detect and respond to speed bumps. This also marked the fist ML model in a traditionally-focused algorithm group and paved the way for adoption of data-centric techniques.

* **Lateral Slip Detection** - Detected lateral tire slip. was cool. thx

* I worked on a complex mathematical optimization problem for a young stealth startup in the construction tech space. My development focused on achieving high accuracy results across a wide range of data in reasonable time, and formed an integral part of their demo MVP offering.

* Back as a student at HUJI, I led a team participating at the 2019 HUJI Hackathon. We developed Beacon, a mobile app that utilizes mesh-networking to relay distress messages for disaster scenarios in which internet connectivity is limited or nonexistent. Our entry won 3rd place. 

* In 2023, I led a team of 5-9 engineers at the BSI command center for identification of missing persons. My responsibility was identifying bottlenecks in the data processing pipleine and preempting tools that would allow for faster ingestion and processing of data.

* I was the owner of a massive legacy system for Structure from Motion. I
