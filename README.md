Source code for my personal website.
Built with Astro and Tailwind, deployed on Netlify.

This is also an experiment with using AI to rapidly learn and then build in a brand new domain. I loved the chance to familiarize myself with concepts in modern front-end web development, which is definitely not my area. 

If you find yourself wandering around this codebase (for whatever reason) and see something you would have done differently, please don't hesitate to let me know. I'd love to learn and improve.
