Winter has been coming and going here in Tel Aviv. Most days it feels humorously warm for November. Global warming is real, I guess...  

It's been a busy few weeks. I've been working on a few projects and have been trying to maintain a routine of exercise, meditation, reading, writing, and connecting with interesting people.

### re-mind
I've been working obsessively on [re-mind](/projects#re-mind) these past few days. The agent is feeling a lot more conversational and is making better decisions. We are testing it every day and I feel like it's starting to give real value. I'm testing different methods of evaluation and adding more guidance to its behavior. There's a small form now [on the site](https://re-mind.chat) to sign up for notification when it's ready.

### Leash training Sol

We're making real progress with leash training Sol for walks in new places. Everyone keeps saying cats shouldn't be leash trained, but he loves it and actively asks to go outside. 
Luna and him are becoming really good friends and feeling more cuddly with each other on the colder days. We still can't believe how well they get along.
