December was full of last-minute travel, unexpected side-quests and enough cold weather to make Tel Aviv's winters feel tropical by comparison.
 
### Germany
I wrapped up the year with a road trip around Germany. Highlights included sipping Glühwein and eating Nürnbergers at Nuremberg's beautiful Christmas market, exploring Bielefeld's surprisingly lively city center, and making a pilgrimage to the Haribo factory store in Bonn. The holiday season in Germany is beautiful but brutally cold. Suddenly our 20°C Tel Aviv December doesn't seem so bad.

### Denmark
I jumped at a last-minute chance to fly to Copenhagen for a weekend, and attend the Radiohead concert at the Royal Arena - a dream I've had since I was 15. The concert blew my already high expectations and was easily one of the highlights of 2025. I spent the rest of the weekend wandering the city's tiny streets and canals, taking in its vibrant architecture. I definitely plan to return when it's warmer to explore more.

### Back in Tel Aviv
Back at my desk now, catching up on projects and readjusting to normal hours. My schedule's pretty open over the next few weeks, so [feel free to reach out](/contact) for intros or collaborations.
