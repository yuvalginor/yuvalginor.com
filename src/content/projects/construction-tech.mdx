Researched, designed and implemented a complex optimization pipeline to improve resource allocation and execution efficiency in steel rebar foundation plans. The project focused on reducing material and labor inefficiencies under multiple real-world constraints. Techniques included linear and integer programming, heuristic search, and performance evaluation across randomized scenarios.
The finished system now serves as a major component of the company's
