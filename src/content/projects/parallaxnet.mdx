Patent-pending neural network for 3D scene reconstruction in autonomous vehicles. Deployed in millions of vehicles at Porsche, Hyundai, and Kia.

## More info

Designed, led research and full productization of a CNN architecture, using LiDAR data for training. Highly optimized for on-chip performance. Patent-pending.

Achieved 52% better accuracy than previous methods while cutting runtime by 2x. This was the first ML model in a traditionally algorithm-focused group, paving the way for broader adoption of data-centric techniques.
