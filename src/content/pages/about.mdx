## About me

<img src="/profile.jpg" alt="Yuval Ginor" class="float-right ml-6 mb-4 w-48 h-56 rounded-lg object-cover" />


I've spent most of my life in or near Tel Aviv, with a few stints of extended travel and several years in Jerusalem while studying.  
That will soon change -  we're relocating to Europe around March 2026 for an extended period of remote work and slow travel. We'll start in Greece and move from there. No strict plan, just following curiosity until we hit a place that feels like home.

I studied Computer Science and Psychology at HUJI, especially drawn to where those fields overlap: artificial intelligence, machine learning, and computationally modeling cognition, human learning, and decision-making behavior. I spent some time in the Computational Cognition Lab, where I used unsupervised learning techniques to identify distinct strategies in how humans approach complex exploration tasks.

Until recently I worked on autonomous driving at [Mobileye](https://www.mobileye.com/), where I founded and led an innovation team focused on 0→1 product opportunities - identifying high-value ideas, building MVPs, testing them in the wild, and scaling what worked into production systems running in millions of vehicles. I loved the pace, the technological depth, and the feeling that our work genuinely mattered. After five years, I realized it was time for a new chapter.

Since then I've been on a much-needed career break, which has allowed me to rethink my priorities and figure out what I'm most interested in pursuing. I also briefly collaborated with an early-stage startup (still in stealth) on mathematical optimization problems - developing a system that became a core part of their MVP offering. It was a challenging and rewarding problem to tackle.


### Some more things you should know:

<text class="text-[var(--color-brand)]"> > </text> I'm bilingual (English & Hebrew) - Hebrew is my mother tongue but I grew up in an American school system. I think and dream in both. I also love learning new languages. Currently very comfortable in Spanish (around B2) and dabbling in Russian.

<text class="text-[var(--color-brand)]"> > </text> I'm really into mindfulness meditation, and somewhat of a secular Buddhist. I've done several silent vipassana retreats ranging from 2 to 10 days. While I remain highly averse to dogmatism, I find that many of these philosophies and practices hold immense practical value in modern day-to-day life. 

<text class="text-[var(--color-brand)]"> > </text> I travel often. I’ve visited [42 countries](https://visitedplaces.com/view/?map=world&projection=geoNaturalEarth1&theme=dark-green&water=1&graticule=0&names=1&duration=2000&placeduration=100&slider=0&autoplay=1&autozoom=none&autostep=1&home=IL&places=My%20Home~IL~1_0_0_-35_-31.4*Europe~AT_BE_BG_CY_CZ_FI_FR_GE_DE_GR_HU_IT_LI_LU_NO_PL_RO_RU_SK_ES_CH_TR_GB_VA~2.4_12.1_53.3_-12.1_-53.3*Asia~KH_CN_HK_IN_LA_MO_MN_NP_LK_TH_VN_IL.daaa44~1.5_83.8_33.3_-83.8_-33.3*North%20America~CA_US~1.6_-100.6_44.4_100.6_-44.4*Africa~EG_ET~1.5_18_1.6_-18_-1.6*South%20America~PE~1.5_-65.9_-20.1_65.9_20.1) to date. I find that travel, like writing and meditation, keeps me grounded and calibrates my sense of what's important.

<text class="text-[var(--color-brand)]"> > </text> I care deeply about impact. In the past I’ve been involved with the Effective Altruism community, and while I’ve grown disillusioned with some of the talk-over-action culture, I still apply many of its principles in how I prioritize - whether it’s projects, career choices, or altruism.

<text class="text-[var(--color-brand)]"> > </text> I love the written word, both as consumer and as producer. 
Writing helps me sort out my thoughts and is my preferred means of communication. Lately I've been devouring audiobooks, which lets me get through my reading list at a pace my actual reading speed would never allow. 

<text class="text-[var(--color-brand)]"> > </text> I'm a musician. My main instrument is my voice, though I also play the guitar quite well and dabble in a lot of other instruments. I also write and record original music. If I weren't doing technology, I may have become a musicia. 

<text class="text-[var(--color-brand)]"> > </text> In a distant past I was really into photography and video editing, and even did it professionally for a bit. Not much has remained from those days, aside from a keen eye for aesthetics and visual language.
