## Places I've Been

<p class="mb-4 text-lg">This is a map of the <b><text class="text-[var(--color-brand)]">~{numCountries} countries</text></b> (depending how you count) I've traveled to so far. I make it a mission to see at least one new country every year (though it usually ends up being a lot more).</p>
