Since wrapping up my [work with the startup](/projects#construction-tech), I've been itching to get back to _building things_ - while also working to maintain focus and re-establish routine: exercise, meditation, reading, writing, and connecting with interesting people.

### New website
I've taken the last couple of days to kick off this new site, which is something I've been wanting to do for a really long time. It's a definite step up from the old one and feels a lot more like me. I'm using Astro + Tailwind, and Sonnet 4.5 has been a real pal in cutting down the ramp-up time.

### re-mind
I've found more time to continue working on [re-mind](/projects#re-mind) lately. I think I have a much better idea of what works well and what needs some finer tuning. We're hoping to have a shareable product ready in the coming weeks, which definitely feels achievable.

### Europe relocation
Nicole and I are making concrete strides toward our move to Europe in March, which is both exciting and terrifying. Moving with a cat and dog means tons of details to take care of. We are leash-training our kitten Sol for walks in new places. He is already comfortable with his harness and now enjoys exploring the neighborhood park, which feels like huge progress.

### Improvisation workshop

The musical improvisation workshop I've been part of for the past few months came to a close this week with an intimate concert for family and friends. What started as a terrifying experience -improvising as a singer- turned out to be one of the most fun and rewarding things I've done this year. I've learned to use my voice as an instrument and confronted my fear of singing in public.
