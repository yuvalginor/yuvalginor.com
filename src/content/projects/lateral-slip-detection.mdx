A novel analytical method for high-resolution detection of lateral tire slip from images and vehicle signals.
Provides a novel capability for detecting traction loss, previously unattainable with traditional sensors. Patent pending.

## More info

Led end-to-end R&D effort, alongside junior engineer and senior researchers across the division.
Approach fuses vision cues with vehicle dynamics to detect lateral traction loss in real time. Validated for real-world use across multiple vehicle types and environments, using diverse benchmarking strategies.
**Achieved 2x better accuracy than projected. Secured strategic deal commitments from VW and Porsche for integration into next-generation safety platforms.**
