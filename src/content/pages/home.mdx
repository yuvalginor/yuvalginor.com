<h1 class="text-[var(--color-brand)]">Hi, I'm Yuval Ginor.</h1>

I'm a builder who loves tackling open-ended problems with real-world impact. I'm obsessively curious; a lifelong learner who has a strong bias for action. I thrive at the intersection of research, product innovation and technical leadership, and am usually working on [several different things at once](/now).

I've led and collaborated on projects across algorithms, ML, and data - from safety-critical systems deployed at major automakers to tools built under extreme time pressure for emergency response. I like to move fast and learn best by doing.

These days I'm especially interested in where AI is heading. I'm experimenting with agentic systems, how to evaluate them, and how to design them to be both impactful and safe.

<text class="text-[var(--color-brand)]"> > </text> I'm on a career break right now, recalibrating priorities and seeking out my next chapter. I'm always curious to connect with like-minded people working on interesting problems.

Check out [/about](/about) for a longer story, [/now](/now) to see what I'm currently obsessed with, or [/projects](/projects) for some things I've built.
