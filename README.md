Source code for my personal website. Built with Astro and Tailwind.

This is also experiment with vibe coding in a brand new domain, and a good intro for me into modern web development, which is definitely not my area.

If you find yourself wandering around this codebase (for whatever reason) and identify some horrible faux-pas, let me know. I'd love to learn and improve.
