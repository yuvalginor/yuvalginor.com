Working with [Nicole](https://linkedin.com/in/nicole-kezlik/) on an agentic chatbot that helps resurface ideas, goals, and intentions at intervals guided by behavioral research to encourage meaningful follow-through. Sign up for updates at [re-mind.chat](https://re-mind.chat)

## More info

re-mind is a way to take back control of what returns to your mind.  
It determines ***when***, ***how*** and ***how often*** to resurface ideas, goals, and intentions to encourage you to act on them.
Currently building with PydanticAI, FastAPI, Celery, Redis, and PostgreSQL, deployed as a chatbot for Telegram/WhatsApp. Currently in closed testing, check back soon for early access :)
