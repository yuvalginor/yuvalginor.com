## About me

<img src="/profile.jpg" alt="Yuval Ginor" class="float-right ml-5 mb-4 w-50 h-64 rounded-lg object-cover" />

I studied CS & Psych at [HUJI](https://en.huji.ac.il/), especially drawn to where these fields overlap: artificial intelligence, machine learning, and computational modeling of cognition and decision-making. I spent some time in the Computational Cognition Lab, where I used unsupervised learning techniques to identify distinct strategies in how humans approach complex exploration tasks.

I spent five years at [Mobileye](https://www.mobileye.com/), where I founded and led an innovation team focused on 0→1 product opportunities: identifying high-value ideas, building prototypes, testing them in the wild, and scaling what worked into production systems running in millions of vehicles. I loved the pace, the technological depth, and the feeling that our work genuinely mattered. After five years, I left to pursue new challenges and accelerate my growth.

I recently worked with an early-stage startup doing applied research for some interesting optimization problems, developing a system that became a core part of their MVP offering.

Now I'm actively seeking my next role - ideally in research engineering, ML, or algorithmic innovation as part of a dynamic team tackling meaningful problems. I thrive in fast-moving teams that value low-ego and high output. 

These days I'm focused on remote work, and will be based in Europe starting in 2026. I'm excited about the flexibility this enables while remaining deeply committed to impactful technical work.

### Some more things you should know:

<text class="text-[var(--color-brand)]"> > </text> I'm bilingual (English & Hebrew). I think and dream in both. I also love learning new languages. I'm conversational in Spanish (~B2) and starting out in Russian. I hold dual citizenship (Israel & Romania).

<text class="text-[var(--color-brand)]"> > </text> I care deeply about impact, and believe in measuring and prioritizing it. In the past I've been involved with the Effective Altruism community and still apply these principles to how I think about problems.

<text class="text-[var(--color-brand)]"> > </text> Writing is how I think. I love the written word and believe clear communication is essential for solving hard problems. I also read a lot.

<text class="text-[var(--color-brand)]"> > </text> I'm a musician, by hobby. My main instrument is my voice, though I also play guitar and a few other instruments. Music gives me perspective and sparks my creativity.

<text class="text-[var(--color-brand)]"> > </text> I practice mindfulness meditation regularly. I find these practices immensely valuable for my clarity, focus and well-being.
