Patent-pending deep neural network for image-based 3D reconstruction in autonomous driving. Deployed in millions of vehicles across multiple OEMs like Porsche, Hyundai, and Kia.

## More info

Led the development across all stages of the project, alongside a junior engineer, replacing an unmaintainable legacy system.
Guided research direction, evaluation methodology, infrastructure design and engineering. Trained using Tensorflow/AWS on LiDAR-derived GT, with inference rewritten and optimized in C++ for on-chip deployment.
Delivered a robust model **with 52% higher accuracy and 2× faster runtime**.
This became the first in-production ML model developed fully in-house within traditionalist Geometry algo group, paving the way for broader adoption across the org.
